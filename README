This is one of the first programs I ever wrote in C.

It is a terminal emulation program for MS-DOS.  It isfFast enough to operate a
14.4k modem (maybe higher) on just a 286.  Most programs can do this, but are
slower when interpreting ANSI sequences and writing to the screen.  Never
completed.  Based on an ANSI parser by Jason Farrell.

Thanks to Saeger and all the other guys from #c on EFnet who helped me to learn
C back in the mid '90s.
